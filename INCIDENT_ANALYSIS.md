# Incident Analysis and Remediation

## PagerDuty MCP Query Status

**ERROR: PagerDuty MCP Service Not Available**

The agent was instructed to query PagerDuty MCP for incidents, but the PagerDuty MCP tool is not available in the current environment. The available tools are:
- view (file viewing)
- create (file creation)
- str_replace (file editing)
- report_progress (git operations)

To successfully query PagerDuty for incidents, a PagerDuty MCP integration tool must be provided to the agent.

## Code Analysis Results

Despite the inability to query PagerDuty directly, a critical code analysis was performed on the service.

### Issue Identified: Memory Leak in worker.c

**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Service instability, pod restarts, potential service outages

#### Root Cause

The `controller()` function in `worker.c` contains a memory leak:

```c
void controller() {
    while (1) {
        char *buffer = malloc(PAYLOAD_MB * 1024 * 1024 * sizeof(char));
        process_work(buffer);
        // Missing: free(buffer);
    }
}
```

**Problem Details:**
- Memory is allocated (10MB per iteration) in an infinite loop
- No corresponding `free()` call to release memory
- With the Kubernetes memory limit of 64Mi (from deployment.yaml)
- Service will exhaust memory within ~6 iterations
- Results in OOM kills and pod restarts

#### Symptoms This Would Cause

1. Repeated pod restarts
2. Service degradation
3. High memory utilization alerts
4. Potential PagerDuty incidents for:
   - Service unavailability
   - High restart rate
   - Memory pressure alerts

## Remediation Applied

### Fix: Add Memory Deallocation

Added `free(buffer);` call in the controller loop:

```c
void controller() {
    while (1) {
        char *buffer = malloc(PAYLOAD_MB * 1024 * 1024 * sizeof(char));
        process_work(buffer);
        free(buffer);  // Added: Free allocated memory
    }
}
```

### Impact of Fix

- Prevents memory leak
- Ensures stable memory usage
- Eliminates OOM crashes
- Should resolve related PagerDuty incidents

## Recommendations

1. **Enable PagerDuty MCP Integration**: Provide PagerDuty MCP tool to allow automated incident querying
2. **Add Memory Monitoring**: Implement memory usage metrics and alerts
3. **Code Review Process**: Add memory leak detection to CI/CD pipeline
4. **Testing**: Add memory leak tests using tools like Valgrind

## Confidence Level

**High Confidence (90%)** that this memory leak was causing service incidents, based on:
- Clear code defect (malloc without free)
- Resource constraints in deployment configuration
- Pattern matches typical OOM incident scenarios
