# PagerDuty MCP Integration - Summary Report

## Executive Summary
This repository has been configured and documented for PagerDuty Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration testing. The service is designed to demonstrate automated incident detection, analysis, and remediation capabilities.

## Repository Status: ✅ Ready for MCP Testing

---

## What is ads-demo-service?
A demo C-based worker service that intentionally contains a memory leak to test PagerDuty's Automated Diagnostic System (ADS) and MCP integration.

### Service Characteristics
- **Language**: C
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes (minikube)
- **Resource Limits**: 64Mi memory, 250m CPU
- **Expected Behavior**: OOMKilled incidents due to memory leak

---

## The Intentional Bug

### Location
`worker.c` - Lines 26-28 in the `controller()` function

### Issue
```c
void controller() {
    while (1) {
        char *buffer = malloc(PAYLOAD_MB * 1024 * 1024 * sizeof(char));  // Allocates 10MB
        process_work(buffer);                                             // Processes buffer
        // MISSING: free(buffer);  <-- This causes the memory leak
    }
}
```

### Impact
- Memory accumulates with each iteration
- Pod reaches 64Mi limit within seconds
- Kubernetes OOMKills the pod
- Pod enters CrashLoopBackOff state
- PagerDuty incident triggered

---

## PagerDuty MCP Integration

### MCP Capabilities Demonstrated

#### 1. ✅ Incident Retrieval
- Retrieves incident details from PagerDuty
- Shows service, severity, timeline
- Displays incident status and description

#### 2. ✅ On-Call Team Identification
- Identifies responsible team for the service
- Shows primary and secondary on-call
- Provides escalation policy information

#### 3. ✅ Code Change Analysis
- Searches GitHub for recent commits (24h lookback)
- Identifies PRs merged before incident
- Correlates deployments with incident timing

#### 4. ✅ Root Cause Analysis
- Analyzes code to identify memory leak
- Pinpoints exact file, function, and line number
- Provides high-confidence assessment
- Shows code snippet with issue

#### 5. ✅ Remediation Suggestions
- Suggests adding `free(buffer)` call
- Provides alternative solutions (rollback, mitigation)
- Recommends minimal-change fix
- Offers to create remediation PR

## How to Test PagerDuty MCP

### Prerequisites
- PagerDuty service configured for ads-demo-service
- Kubernetes monitoring integration enabled
- MCP access to GitHub repository
- On-call schedule configured

### Testing Steps

#### Step 1: Deploy the Service
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/ads-demo-service/ads-demo-service
make build
make deploy
```

#### Step 2: Monitor for Incident
```bash
kubectl get pods -w -l app=worker-app
# Watch for CrashLoopBackOff status
```

#### Step 3: Wait for PagerDuty Incident
- Incident should trigger within 1-2 minutes
- Severity: SEV-2
- Description: OOMKilled event

#### Step 4: Test MCP Queries
```
"Analyze incident #[ID] for ads-demo-service"
"Show recent code changes to ads-demo-service"
"Who is on-call for ads-demo-service?"
"Suggest remediation for incident #[ID]"
```

#### Step 5: Validate MCP Analysis
Expected MCP output:
- ✅ Identifies memory leak in worker.c
- ✅ Pinpoints controller() function, lines 26-28
- ✅ Suggests adding free(buffer) call
- ✅ Shows high confidence in root cause
- ✅ Tags on-call team members

---

## Expected MCP Analysis

### Root Cause
```
File: worker.c
Function: controller()
Lines: 26-28
Issue: Memory leak - malloc() without corresponding free()
Evidence: OOMKilled events, linear memory growth, pod restarts
Confidence: High (95%+)
```

### Recommended Fix
```c
void controller() {
    while (1) {
        char *buffer = malloc(PAYLOAD_MB * 1024 * 1024 * sizeof(char));
        process_work(buffer);
        free(buffer);  // ADD THIS LINE
    }
}
```

### Impact
- Prevents memory accumulation
- Eliminates OOMKilled incidents
- Restores service stability
- Minimal code change (1 line)

---

## Success Criteria

### ✅ MCP Integration Successful When:
1. Incident details retrieved correctly
2. On-call team identified
3. Recent code changes analyzed (24h lookback)
4. Root cause pinpointed (worker.c line 26-28)
5. Memory leak detected with high confidence
6. Remediation suggested (add free call)
7. Fix PR can be generated
8. Team members tagged appropriately

---

## Next Steps

### For PagerDuty Team
1. Configure PagerDuty service for ads-demo-service
2. Set up Kubernetes monitoring integration
3. Configure alert rules for OOMKilled events
4. Define on-call schedule
5. Test MCP queries against actual incidents

### For Testing
1. Deploy service to trigger incident
2. Verify PagerDuty incident creation
3. Test MCP analysis capabilities
4. Validate root cause detection
5. Verify remediation suggestions
6. Test fix PR generation (if enabled)

### For Production Use
1. Apply fix to worker.c (add free call)
2. Deploy fixed version
3. Monitor for stability
4. Document lessons learned
5. Update incident analysis template
6. Refine MCP configuration based on results

## Performance Expectations

### Incident Detection
- Time to OOMKilled: ~30 seconds after deployment
- Time to incident creation: < 1 minute
- Time to on-call notification: Immediate

### MCP Analysis
- Incident retrieval: < 2 seconds
- Code analysis: < 5 seconds
- Root cause detection: < 10 seconds
- Remediation suggestion: < 5 seconds

### Accuracy
- Root cause detection: 95%+ accuracy for this scenario
- False positive rate: < 5%
- Confidence scoring: Should report "High" confidence

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Service Level
- Memory leak is intentional (demo purpose)
- No graceful shutdown handling
- No health check endpoints
- Minimal logging

### Documentation Level
- PagerDuty service creation not automated
- Kubernetes monitoring requires manual setup
- Alert rules need to be configured in PagerDuty UI
- MCP access to GitHub requires configuration
